👋 Hi, I’m @Francesco-Rianna
👀 I’m interested in web development and programming.
🌱 I’m currently studying at Boolean, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, Laravel, and Vue.js, as well as the PHP programming language.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects that utilize these technologies.
