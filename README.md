ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Francesco-Rianna ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about web development and programming. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with Caulia S.R.L, a newly founded startup, and have recently completed my studies at Boolean, where I focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, Laravel, and Vue.js, as well as the PHP programming language.  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development projects that utilize these technologies. ðŸ“« How to reach me: francesco.rianna1998@gmail.com
